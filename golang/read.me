		  runtime improvements can be done here:
		  1. Discard processing base 2 numbers -> never going to be on top
		  2. By observation 1: Top 10 come from original odd numbers. Discard processing original even numbers can be done?
		  3. By observation 2: Greater values are always create by the second half (Ex: i=10000, can start with i>500. reduce 50% )
